Some Poetry I wrote almost a score ago.

- Title: _Apocryphal_ 
- Link: https://www.verse-virtual.org/2014/November/victor-ehikioya-2014-november.html
- Theme:
	> Apocryphal, for me, is about survival and grace. It was about steadfastly trusting oneself in situations where reality becomes dire. It was committing myself to nature, reminiscent of my childhood. Above all, it was about knowing my own limitations and seeking acceptance beyond what my mortal attire could muster. This poem was mostly edited by David Firestone and is dedicated to him.


- Title: _Slave Girl_
- Link: https://thecamelsaloon.blogspot.com/2014/09/slave-girl.html
- Theme:
	> The constant reminder of Wole Soyinka's `"Idanre"` brought to life my deepest fears. I wondered whether I would remain bound by inherited mistakes, if my ancestors would guide me, or if I would continue in a tradition chosen for me. "Slave Girl" symbolized a culmination of mistakes, pain, and the desire for escape. But where could I escape to?


- Title: _Collection_
- Link: https://www.verse-virtual.org/2015/March/victor-brown-omovbude-2015-march.html

	> This is a collection of poems. Of love, trust, and tradition.


- Title: _Life is Short. Art is Long_
- Link: https://www.verse-virtual.org/2015/August/victor-brown-omovbude-2015-august.html
- Theme:
	> Life is short. Art is long. This is me, wrapped and moonwalking through the cosmos.
