Our decisions define the outcome of what we become. In most cases, it is as difficult as teaching rap music to a Vietnamese from the South or as complex as handling reconciliation logic in a Kubernetes controller – of course, ensuring that the desired state of the resources matches the actual state in a highly dynamic and distributed environment. 

This same view relates to the world of technology. Small, attainable decisions beget grounded domain knowledge, and this knowledge ushers us into the futuristic reality we desire. But all of these come at a cost. Something must break for the next one to work. It's often a two-way street.

> For the most part, cost is the Key, and the Value is design. But then you ask, what is design? Is it a blank page with strings? Is it Edvard Munch’s vivid brushstrokes capturing raw emotion? Or is it the delicate interplay of ASCII letters in an 82 by 27 terminal? For the curious mind, “design, at its core, is the synthesis of intent and creativity–the fusion of purpose and form”. 

In technology, design manifests as the architecture behind systems, the choices we make in algorithms, structures, and UI. Every decision, like those in life, can steer the course of innovation, creating either harmony or chaos. 

The rate at which software is developed in the cloud is massive and an architectural brilliance. Most of the world's data are already in the cloud, and the expansion thereof will greatly impact the next decade of our lives and technology. Each blank page provides us enough leverage to think through systems, tradeoffs, and the impact of how we design our algorithms. 

Ultimately, design is that balance–where art meets functionality and small, thoughtful decisions culminate in our vast interconnected world.
