My main interests in Kubernetes are in APIs, Controllers, and Operators. For Infrastructure as Code (IaC), I work extensively with Terraform for provisioning infrastructures and distributed systems). I also have a strong affinity for networking, especially Load Balancing for GCP and Kubernetes, whether at Layer 4 or Layer 7 or with external resources.

I find Go and Rust to be beautiful languages. For Go, I focus on concurrency, as building low-level API services or distributed systems heavily relies on the benchmark of concurrency.

Apart from working with technology, I write poetry and try not to bite my tongue when speaking and learning German.

In my free time, I watch a lot of anime, ranging from films like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke to series like Ippo and Demon Slayer.
