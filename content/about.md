My interests are Kubernetes (APIs, controllers, and operators), IaC (with Terraform, mostly complex infrastructures), 
and distributed systems. For cloud services, I mostly focus on GKE and LoadBalancing. 

Golang & Rust are cool dialects to work with! I focus mostly on Concurrency with Golang. Trying to conquer the ecosystem is
a nigh-impregnable task. The same goes for the tools above.

I watch a ton of Anime & write Poetry. 
Learning German and Italiano (I can't speak mine). Both are beautiful languages.

This is it, I can't find a way to make this colorful. Well, you can do anything, but you can't do everything!
